# Frontend

Current frontend is a static dashboard in `index.html`.

Capabilities:
- Upload trades
- Refresh prices
- Load metrics and positions
- Set API base URL, snapshot date, and account filter

Local run:
- Backend serves this UI at `http://localhost:8000/`

If hosting separately (for example Netlify), point `API Base URL` to your deployed backend.
